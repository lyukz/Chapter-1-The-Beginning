# Chapter 1: The Beginning
 A collection of resources for learning about deep learning and AI development. This repository has been created to collect and store valuable information that can be used when developing AI models.

 This includes:
 * RNNs
 * LSTM
 * Classifiers
 * General domain knowledge

 **To whom?**
 
 This repository was not created with a particular audience in mind, rather it is for me, so that I can document the journey.

 **What is the end goal?**

 No clear end goal is present. We will go as far as possible.
