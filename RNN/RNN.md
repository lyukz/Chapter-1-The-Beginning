# RNN: Recurrent Neural Networks

*A type of artifical neural network that uses sequential data or time series data*

**Time series data**

Time series data is a sequence of data points that are ordered by time. Examples of this include:

* Stock market prices
* Temperature at an interval of 24 hours
* Any data that has a specific time interval

**Sequential data**

Sequential data is data in where the order of how the data is ordered matters. 

These two data types are quite similar. The difference would be only that in *sequential data* the time of each data point is not relevant .

**What are recurrent neural networks used for?**

* Language translation
* Natural Language Processing, NLP
* Speech recognition
* Attempts to predict the stock market
* Text generation

**What makes RNNs interesting?**
